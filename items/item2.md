## Bored Box

The bored box is a design that myself and my fellow group members envisioned when we were challenged with the task of hacking an ordinary box. 

## My Angle

When thinking about ways to best hack a box, we thought of many different possibilities. From accessible boxes to help disabled people to a box that can act as a tool for entertainment. We narrowed our focus on the topic to create a box that focuses on the accessibility of entertainment for the most number of people. In keeping with this idea, weâ€™ve created the bored box. The bored box consists of six of the most popular board games in the world on one box. Each face of the box will feature one game. The inside of the bored box will have twelve slots for game materials and pieces and well as extra slots for storage of other games. The games featured on this box are Monopoly, The Game of Life, Scrabble, Snakes and Ladders, Connect Four, Chess and Checkers. The inside of the box will also include a deck of playing cards and uno with braille on them. This box is focused on providing entertainment to anyone in the family. The bored box is designed with accessibility in mind and will have features to make the experience enjoyable for all.
