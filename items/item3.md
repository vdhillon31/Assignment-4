## We Wheels

The We Wheels is a design for a wheelchair that myself and three group members designed. It was for an assignment that asked us to design a DIY design with a social impact.

## My Angle

Just a few days ago, I had experienced something that sparked an idea. My family has a rental unit that needed a tenant and we received a phone call from a man who uses a wheelchair. He came to see the property but unfortunately, he could not rent the place because we did not have an accessible ramp. While we will be looking at installing one, I thought that this man likely has difficulty finding a place to rent. So, we thought about the basic idea about how we can make life easier for those in a wheelchair by creating a retractable ramp inside of the wheelchair. We then looked at more efficient ways of designing this idea and we then revamped the entire basic wheelchair to create the We Wheel. With wheels that climb stairs and go off road, as well as a full standing position for maneuverability, the We Wheel is the solution to modern wheelchair shortcomings.
