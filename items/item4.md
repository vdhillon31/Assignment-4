# Design 3
## Laurier Humanities Website

In the first UX class of the program, we were tasked with designing changes to the Laurier Humanities Program to garner more interest in the program.

## My Angle

Initially, myself and my group members simply looked at how we could potentially influence more high school students to take the humanities program. We conducted simple surveys and saw that the issues around the humanities enrollment were directly related to content. The content of the classes are often not highlighted in the high school level. Our goal was to make the website more appealing and the program more exciting. We did this by innovating the website to create more of an inside look into the program and the potential future of graduates. This would allows students to understand that the humanities have tons to offer not only for a learning experience but also a career.
